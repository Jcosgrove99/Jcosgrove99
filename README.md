<h1 align="center">Hi I'm Jake ðŸ¤™ </h1>

## ðŸ’« About Me
Currently I'm working as a machine learning engineer, and interested in learning and becoming the best engineer I can. My fromal education was in economics which introduced me to data science and programming. Since then I have been trying to learn about how to write production qualtiy software, building backend services, automating with LLMs, and even a little front end web development. 

## ðŸš€ What I'm Up To

- ðŸ’» Building new tools with LLM's
- ðŸŽ¤ Venturing into new possibilities with LLM voice capabilities
- ðŸ“± Learning how front end engineering works to become a better backend engineer
- ðŸ¤– Exploring Machine Learning with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
